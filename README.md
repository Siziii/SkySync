# SkySync

SkySync is a weather forecast application designed to provide users with a visually appealing and intuitive way to check the weather. I created this project to practice fetching data from APIs, utilizing three different APIs for various functionalities.

The project is made with Vite & React and styled with Tailwind. It has been deployed and is accessible online via Vercel at [SkySync](https://SkySync-forecast.vercel.app)
